Bitstream file name: HYBRID_A_QUALCOMM_1.bit

Bitstream feature name: Conformance hybrid scalability

Bitstream feature description:
The conformance bitstream for hybrid scalability.
The coded bitstream only contains enhancement layer whereas reconstructed base layer is expected to be provided externally.

- Coding structure: Random access main
- Number of Frames: 15
- Reconstructed base layer is provided in this package with file name: BaseLayerSequence.yuv

Output Layer Sets:
- OLS_0 - Should be provided externally.
- OLS_1 -   Layer: 1, PTL Idx: 2 (Scalable Main 4.1)

Number of layers: 2 (but only EL available in the bitstream)

Profile, Tier, Level information: Num PTL = 3
- PTL_Idx 0 - Profile: MAIN [V1 Whole Bitstream PTL]
              Level: 4.1
- PTL_Idx 1 - Profile: MAIN [Base layer PTL]
              Level: 3.1
- PTL_Idx 2 - Profile: SCALABLE MAIN [Ehhancement layer PTL]
              Level: 4.1

Each layer resolution:
- Layer 0 resolution - Output: 1280x720
                       Coded:  1280x720
- Layer 1 resolution - Output: 1920x1080
                       Coded:  1920x1280

Frame rate: 30 fps for both layers
