Bitstream file name: MVHEVCS_D_NTT_1
Explanation of bitstream features: All slices are coded as I, P or B slices. Only the first picture of each view is coded as IDR picture. Each picture contains only one slice. NumViews is equal to 2. NumDirectRefLayers is always equal to 0, meaning inter-view prediction is disabled. The two views are with different spatial resolutions. All NAL units are encapsulated into the byte stream format specified in ITU-T Rec. H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2. To conform the case when different spatial resolutions for two views are used.
Picture size: 1024x768 for view0, 512x384 for view1
Frame rate: 30 fps

Software: HTM13.0 based private software
