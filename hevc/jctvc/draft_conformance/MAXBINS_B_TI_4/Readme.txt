MAXBINS_B_TI_4:(MAXBINS_B_TI_4.bit)

Spec version: HM11.0
Profile: Main
Level: 2
(Category: Entropy Coding; Sub-category: Maximum number of bins)

The purpose of the stream is to reach within 95% of the maximum number of bins per LCU based on the 5120 bits per 16x16 LCU constraint (IPCM is enabled).
